# Data Science Models 

Models Implemented
* Unsupervised Autoencoder
* Supervised Autoencoder
* Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet clone)
* Convolutional Neural Network (Transfer Learning)
* Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)

These models were implemented to solve data science problems from several datasets on Kaggle. The notebooks not only implement the model,
but also analyze the datasets and augment the data for better results.
